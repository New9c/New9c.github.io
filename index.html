                    This algorithm ain't perfect, specifics are written later. Just know that I don't want 
                    to be held accountable for any actions you make because of the results.

                    Hello! This algorithm predicts when you'll get your new starr road brawler.
                    I also made one to predict the rewards you'll get in ? days, for those who have all the brawlers.

                    I recommend using this right after you've collect all tokens available for today, 
                    but it should be pretty good in other scenarios too.
                    <br><br>
                    Have fun! :D
